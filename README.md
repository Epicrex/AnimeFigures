|[AmiAmi](https://www.amiami.com/eng/) (Buy)|✅Though the website can be quite buggy and orders taking quite long to ship, it still is one of the better places to get figures. (In particular watch out for the order system. Make sure things are really in the order basket/ are ordered. And if other users buy a figure it can be taken from your basket. Package tracking updates are also bad.)
