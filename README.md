# General [^](#Table-Of-Contents)

[MyFigureCollection](https://myfigurecollection.net/) is an anime figure collecting community where people share imags of their figures. It is also a data base for figures and can help with finding new figures or even aid in avoiding bootlegs.

# Some Terms [^](#Table-Of-Contents)
Bootleg:
```
"Simply put, a bootleg is a figure that does not have any proper licensing or approval.
Generally, bootlegs are copycats (normally of lesser quality) of actual,
licensed figures which are sold to collectors or vendors under the guise of the legitimate figure."
```

Proxy Shipper:
```
Proxy-buying means shopping using a third-party to purchase an item on your behalf.
They buy the item and ship it to you in exchange for a fee. The proxy shipper needs to be in the country of the product for it to work.
```

|[AmiAmi](https://www.amiami.com/eng/) (Buy)|✅ Though the website can be quite buggy and orders taking quite long to ship, it still is one of the better places to get figures. _(In particular watch out for the order system. Make sure things are really in the order basket/ are ordered. And if other users buy a figure it can be taken from your basket. Package tracking updates are also bad.)_
